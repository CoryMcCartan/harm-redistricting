Dear NHB editors,

Please find attached a pdf copy of the manuscript, entitled "Individual and
Differential Harm in Redistricting," which my coauthor and I hope you find
suitable for publication in NHB.

This manuscript is an interdisciplinary investigation into the issue of
measuring measuring individual- and group-based harms in district-based
democracies.  It propopses a new framework that combines cutting-edge
computational methodology with a new theoretical foundation. By building up
from the individual level, this framework allows fairness to be measured
relative to any group membership or individual characteristic.  Further, by
combining geographic data of individuals with recent advances in redistricting
simulation, we provide a measurement strategy which accounts for political
geography directly.  The core idea is that an individual is harmed when their
preferred candidate is not the winner but under a counterfactual plan, their
preferred candidate would have likely won.

Given the new framework, we then apply it to partisan gerrymandering in New
Jersey, to allow for comparison with existing measures of partisan fairness.
We then apply the framework to the case of Alabama, where we demonstrate that
harm falls more along racial lines than partisan lines, via an ecological
inference based model of racial voting.  Finally, we perfom a novel study
of Democratic primary voting in the city of Boston to analyze the impact
of race-conscious district lines for city council.

Thanks for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

Cory McCartan
