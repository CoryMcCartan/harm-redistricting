Dear Dr. Wang,

Please find attached our revised manuscript, "Individual and
Differential Harm in Redistricting," which my coauthor and I hope you find
suitable for publication in NHB.

The word limit for the manuscript required substantial edits and reorganization.
Most of the technical details, other than the formalization of the proposed
framework itself, have been moved to the methods section.  The remaining
edits are described in the attached Response to the editors and reviewers.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Cory McCartan
