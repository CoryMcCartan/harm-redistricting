ABSTRACT
- start with why
- kosuke: nail down what your contribution is & then lead with that
- adam: tie to protected groups -- hit us over the head w/ it -- give examples. 'fact that it generalizes just means you did a good job theoretically'
- kosuke: explain e.g. how partisan bias is unworkable in racial case
- tyler: talk about counterfactual contribution, too
- kosuke: may not be able to fit all your contributions in the abstract. core thing is fixing the gap where existing methods can't be applied
- adam: connect to ML fairness!  

INTRO
- kosuke: like mini examples. lots of this lit comes from US context. As a result not flexible.  Consider an international example to highlight limitations further

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
- kosuke: "you don't need legal literature to justify what you're doing". idea itself makes sense. basically causal inference.  can connect to legal lit
- kosuke: start with 'why is there no measure of racial gerrymandering'?  (cory note: maybe de-emphasize Gingles connection up front) 

FIG 5: just use diagonal

STRUCTURE:
- Kosuke: like mini-examples, but can make it seem like this is just another partisan gerrymandering paper
- not a huge appetite to get rid of section 2
- kosuke: "don't narrow yourself down to 'we do better than this other thing'"

EI MODELS:
- kosuke: move models to their own paper
- cory: I think we need them to estimate things
- kosuke: if it's critical to your application then you should discuss/motivate it more
