Revision notes:

ABSTRACT:

1st sentence: study of redistricting has been obsessed w parties. 
2nd sentence: As a result, existing tools are ill-suited to study racial, multi-party, local, etc. redistricting.
3rd sentence: We remedy by reanchoring @ indiv level, leading to a unified framework...
4th sentence: individual + counterfactual = harm
5th sentence: notion of harm -> estimate
6th: applications (new purchase...)


INTRO:
1st ¶: gerrymandering is more than 2-party squabbling in the US.
eg. Alabama and Boston

2nd ¶: Despite the breadth of the problem, academics have completely ignored (shame!!!!) these other instances. Why? 
- quant people have been limited in estimation strategies
- US case + legal context have skewed academic research toward legally-revelant qs. I.e. EI models, Gingles criteria
- many partisan measures. All two parties

3rd ¶: This paper moves beyond the 2-party case, indiv harm, etc.  (Current 2nd & erd ¶s)

reorient discussion of counterfactuals --- we make them explicit, which is an improvment on implicit ones currently (which also target the wrong thing).  See kosuke's comment
stress that harm thing is relative. but that's a good thing.


similarities with legal -- reframe as 'this pulls together threads from legal framework' etc. Not too explicit

more specific with harm counterfactuals etc in intro -- readily grasped examples


MOTIVATION:
condense to one example that also covers race

FORMAL SECTION:
win_{q(i)} -> win_i  (mention PO notation in text)

NJ: use actual NJ plans
