	abstract = {Segregation across social groups is an enduring feature of nearly all human societies and is associated with numerous social maladies. In many countries, reports of growing geographic political polarization raise concerns about the stability of democratic governance. Here, using advances in spatial data computation, we measure individual partisan segregation by calculating the local residential segregation of every registered voter in the United States, creating a spatially weighted measure for more than 180 million individuals. With these data, we present evidence of extensive partisan segregation in the country. A large proportion of voters live with virtually no exposure to voters from the other party in their residential environment. Such high levels of partisan isolation can be found across a range of places and densities and are distinct from racial and ethnic segregation. Moreover, Democrats and Republicans living in the same city, or even the same neighbourhood, are segregated by party.},

They use four algorithms that weight traditional districting criteria (equal population, the preservation of county integrity, and district area compactness) to generate 10,000 alternative plans containing a total of 60,000 congressional districts. Based upon the analysis of these plans, the authors conclude that: (1) race is a factor in the design of South Carolina's congressional districts; (2) race predominates over the preservation of county lines; and (3) race may predominate over district compactness.},
