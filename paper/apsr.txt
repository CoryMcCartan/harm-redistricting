Dear APSR editors,

Please find attached a pdf copy of the manuscript, entitled "Individual and
Differential Harm in Redistricting," which my coauthor and I hope you find
suitable for publication in APSR.

This manuscript presents a new framework for measuring individual- and
group-based harms in district-based democracies. By building from the
individual, this allows fairness to be measured relative to any group
membership or individual characteristic.  Further, by combining geographic data
of individuals with recent advances in redistricting simulation, we provide a
measurement strategy which accounts for political geography directly.  The core
idea is that an individual is harmed when their preferred candidate is not the
winner but under a counterfactual plan, their preferred candidate would have
likely won.

Given the new framework, we then apply it to partisan gerrymandering in New
Jersey, to allow for comparison with existing measures of partisan fairness.
We then apply the framework to the case of Alabama, where we demonstrate that
harm falls more along racial lines than partisan lines.  Third, we use these
new tools to study Boston redistricting, which lacks interparty competition.
There, we provide a demonstration of how Black voters benefit in redistricting
from race-awareness, via an ecological inference based model of ideology.

Thanks for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
